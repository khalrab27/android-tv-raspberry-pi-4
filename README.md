## Get started using Android TV

- You can use your phone as a remote for Android TV using [this guide](https://support.google.com/googletv/answer/11136134).
- If you have a case with a fan for your Raspberry Pi, you can enable overclocking to get the most out of the Pi's CPU.
  - Go to Settings.
  - Click on _System_.
  - Click on _Raspberry Pi settings_.
  - Under the _Overclock_ section, press _Maximum CPU frequency_ and change it to whatever you see fit.
